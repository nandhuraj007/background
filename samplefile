To achieve this functionality in Flutter, you'll need to use a combination of SharedPreferences to store the timestamp when the text should change and a background process like flutter_workmanager to periodically check the timestamp and update the text accordingly. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Setup:
First, you need to include the required dependencies in your pubspec.yaml file:

yaml
Copy code
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  shared_preferences: ^2.0.12
  flutter_workmanager: ^0.4.0
Implementing the UI:
Create a Flutter app with a simple UI containing the text that you want to change. In this example, I'll create a page with a Text widget that displays either "hai" or "happy" based on the condition.

dart
Copy code
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: MyPage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyPageState createState() => _MyPageState();
}

class _MyPageState extends State<MyPage> {
  String _displayText = "hai";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _updateDisplayText();
  }

  void _updateDisplayText() async {
    // Check if enough time has passed to change the text
    bool shouldChangeText = await shouldChangeText();
    setState(() {
      _displayText = shouldChangeText ? "happy" : "hai";
    });
  }

  Future<bool> shouldChangeText() async {
    SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
    int timestamp = prefs.getInt('timestamp') ?? 0;
    int currentTime = DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch;
    return currentTime - timestamp >= 8000 * 1000; // 8000 seconds
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text("Text Changer"),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          _displayText,
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
Implementing Background Task:
To update the text even when the app is closed, you can use flutter_workmanager to schedule a background task that periodically checks and updates the text.

dart
Copy code
import 'package:flutter_workmanager/flutter_workmanager.dart';

void callbackDispatcher() {
  Workmanager().executeTask((task, inputData) {
    _updateDisplayText();
    return Future.value(true);
  });
}

void main() {
  Workmanager().initialize(callbackDispatcher);
  runApp(MyApp());
}
Remember that Flutter is not intended for long-running background processes, and there might be limitations based on the platform and device. Also, handling background tasks requires careful consideration of battery usage and performance.

Please note that the above example is a basic demonstration. In a real-world scenario, you might need to handle more edge cases and ensure the background task behaves as expected across different devices and platforms.sample file
